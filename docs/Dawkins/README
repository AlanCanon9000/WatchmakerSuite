Watchmaker Suite for Mac ClassicVersion of January 13, 2015Prepared by Alan Canon <alancanon9000@gmail.com>This version of Watchmaker Suite represents a minimally cleaned-up version of all four Watchmaker applications, which should compile cleanly under the supplied ThinkPascal 4.0 compiler.The primary purpose of this version is to provide the primary author, Richard Dawkins, with an archival quality companion to the ResusciateWatchmaker.sitx archive initially transmitted to Alan Canon.The "Running Applications" folder contains freshly built executables for all four of the Watchmaker programs, as proof that the programs do compile and execute cleanly.
