  <h1>Richard Dawkins' Watchmaker Suite</h1>
  <a href="jars/WatchmakerSuite.jar">Download and Run (you will need Java 6 or later installed, and grant permission to run)</a>
  <br>
  <p>On this site you will find three versions of Watchmaker Suite:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Richard Dawkins' Original Pascal Sources in THINK Pascal 4.0</li>
    <li>Watchmaker Suite Second Edition in THINK Pascal 4.0, edited by Alan Canon in Lazarus and THINK Pascal 4.0</li>
    <li>The official port of Watchmaker Suite, in Java.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Java Port</h2>
  <p>
  Runnable versions require Java 6 or later installed. You will need to grant permission for the 
  application to run once downloaded: on the Mac, the application will fail to run the first time: go into System Settings, choose "Security",
  and grant permission for the downloaded application to run.
  </p>

<h2>Applet versions</h2>
<p>These require Java 6 or later, and a browser that supports running unsigned applets (currently, only Firefox on Linux has been tested.)</p>

<h3>Original Pascal Sources</h3>
  <a href="Dawkins/index.html">Primary Sources: Dawkins' Original Watchmaker Code</a>
  <p>This section documents ResuscitateWatchmaker.sitx, the 
  archive of original the Blind Watchmaker programs, as donated to the project by Richard Dawkins.</p>
<h3>Pascal Second Edition</h3>
<a href="pascal2ndEd/index.html">This section</a> documents the "Second Edition" Pascal sources. The goal of the Second Edition
was to clean up the original Blind Watchmaker programs so that they would compile cleanly under both the original Think Pascal 4.0 platform,
as well as the latest version of FreePascal. Among currently maintained open source Pascal 
compilers, FreePascal is best suited to the dialect of Pascal in which the original Blind Watchmaker programs were written.
