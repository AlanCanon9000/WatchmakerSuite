  <h1>Richard Dawkins' Watchmaker Suite</h1>
  <p>On this site you will find three versions of Watchmaker Suite:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Richard Dawkins' Original Pascal Sources in THINK Pascal 4.0</li>
    <li>Watchmaker Suite Second Edition in THINK Pascal 4.0, edited by Alan Canon in Lazarus and THINK Pascal 4.0</li>
    <li>The official port of Watchmaker Suite, in Java.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Java Port</h2>
  <p>
  Runnable versions require Java 6 or later installed. You will need to grant permission for the 
  application to run once downloaded: on the Mac, the application will fail to run the first time: go into System Settings, choose "Security",
  and grant permission for the downloaded application to run.
  </p>

<h2>Applet versions</h2>
<p>These require Java 6 or later, and a browser that supports running unsigned applets (currently, only Firefox on Linux has been tested.)</p>
